# ShoppyGlobe E-commerce Application
ShoppyGlobe is a React-based e-commerce app showcasing features like product browsing, cart management, API integration, and responsive design. It uses Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and optimizes performance with lazy loading, making it a great learning project and portfolio addition.
## Features
1. Component Structure: Organized components like `App`, `Header`, `ProductList`, `ProductItem`, `ProductDetail`, `Cart`, `CartItem`, `Checkout`, `Footer` and `NotFound`.
2. Data Management: Fetch product data from an API using `useEffect`. Use Redux for state management, including actions and reducers for cart functionalities. Handle API errors gracefully.
3. Routing: Navigation through React Router with routes for Home, Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout pages.
4. Search Feature: Filter products in the `ProductList` component.
5. Dynamic Interaction: Add products to the cart and modify/remove them dynamically.
6. Responsive Design: Ensure the app adapts to various screen sizes.
7. Performance Optimization: Code splitting and lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
8. Styling: Custom CSS for aesthetics.
